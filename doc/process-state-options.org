* Problem
** We want to capture state during a process. One action may receive data that has to be preserved and sent back later.
** simulant.sim/perform-action is a multimethod that receives two arguments: action and process.
** both action and process are Datomic entities.
** Simulant keeps a pool of agents and dispatches actions on processes to those agents.
** Processes are multiplexed across agents.
** All multimethod implementations must have the same arity.
* Common to all options
** Always merge the updated process-state into the agent-state.
** This allows the process -> agent multiplexing to continue.
** Want to avoid breaking API changes
* Options
** Magic key in existing argument
*** Modify simulant.sim/feed-action to merge an extra key into either `action` or `process`.
*** Use perform-action's return value as the new state
*** Pros & cons
+ Minimally intrusive
+ Transparent to existing users
- Ugly
- Asymmetric
- Requires a 'magic' key in a map to smuggle in an argument
** Dynamically bind a function
*** Bind a symbol in feed-action to act like a function.
*** perform-action can get the current state by calling that function
*** Use perform-action's return value as the new state
*** Pros & cons
+ Transparent to existing users
+ Not very intrusive
- A bit of magic
- Asymmetric
** Introduce a new process type
*** Augment sim.type/basic with sim.type/stateful
*** Dispatch to different feeders for stateful sim types.
*** Define a method other than perform-action
*** Pros & cons
+ Extends the framework in ways it was meant to be extended
- Larger change
- May have a ripple effect that we cannot hide from existing users
** Introduce an orthogonal concept about processes: Causaulity
*** Add an attribute to the simulant schema :process/causality
*** Allowed values are :process.causality/independent (default) and :process.causality/dependent.
*** Inside simulant.sim/feed-action, we check for this attribute
*** If the process is causally dependent, then we call a new multimethod `simulant.sim/perform-dependent-action` that takes the state as a third argument
*** Pros & cons
+ Small intrusion in simulant
+ Non-breaking change
- Must apply to all actions in a process, cannot be piecemeal
- Minor nit: proliferating multimethods
** Introduce an orthogonal concept about actions: statefulness
*** Add an attribute to the simulant schema :action/statefulness
*** Allowed values are :action.statefulness/stateful and :action.statefulness/stateless (default)
*** Inside simulant.sim/feed-action, we check for this attribute
*** If the action is stateful, we call `simulant.sim/perform-action` with _3_ arguments: action, process, and state.
*** We have to change the defmulti for perform-action so it is variadic. This is a non-breaking change for simulant users
*** Whatever the user function returns becomes the new state of the process
*** Pros & cons
+ Small intrusion in simulant
+ Non-breaking change
+ Can mix stateful and stateless actions in a single process
** Introduce a new namespace
*** Make a `simulant.sim-stateful` namespace
*** Has similar multimethods, but `perform-action` takes an additional argument for the state.
*** Use perform-action's return value as the new state.
*** Factor out common functions from `simulant.sim` and `simulant.sim-stateful`.
*** Pros & cons
+ Cleanest interface to perform-action. State passes right through.
+ Non-breaking for existing users
- Largest change
- Future maintenance burden to keep both flavors synchronized
** Provide a database per process to store their state
*** Create a database per process
*** Provide the simulation with a service to retrieve the database for the process
*** Within an action, it can transact and query against that database
*** Pros & cons
+ Does not require API change to perform-action.
+ Even more general than a state map.
+ No new attributes/types/modes/etc required
+ Fits into services lifecycle
+ Can be optional to the sim. (I.e., it's possible to have a sim that
  _doesn't_ use this feature.)
- Will be slower than a map
- Higher memory consumption, especially if we use in-memory DBs

+ Processes could communicate globally
- Will be slower than a map
- Processes must be careful to avoid key collisions, schema
  conflicts, entity modifications.
- Would definitely require a storage-backed database rather than in-memory
* Selected solution
** Provide a database per process to store their state
